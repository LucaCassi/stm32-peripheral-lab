I strongly reworked an already existing and previously used project of mine for this demonstration.  
All settings and parameters are intended to be technically reasonable, even though the overall configuration is highly specific and would not be directly deployable on a different board or project without a certain level of adaptation.

I intentionally included most of the features and configurations that I have encountered in industrial applications.

In particular, the oversampling configuration and the different sampling times are not chosen by chance:  
the goal is to (almost) saturate the DMA channel, under the assumption that the injected conversions are triggered at approximately 16 kHz, which is a reasonable order of magnitude for a high-precision Field-Oriented Motor Control application.

This approach is deliberately stress-oriented and meant to reason about timing margins, DMA contention, and system-level trade-offs rather than to represent a production-ready configuration.

Regarding the application-level code (adc_app.h / adc_app.c), it should be considered a first-pass integration rather than a finalized abstraction layer.
The API and parameter consistency would benefit from an additional review before being reused as a generic or reusable module. In particular, the choice and grouping of input parameters is not always uniform, and the overall code structure reflects a merge of manually written logic and auto-generated code.
